The main goal was to analyze key performance metrics and create two dynamic dashboards that would empower data-driven decision-making across the business:

ðŸ”¹ Strategic Dashboard: Designed to provide high-level business insights and track key performance indicators.

ðŸ”¹ Analytical Dashboard: Focused on detailed transaction analysis, product trends, customer behavior, and store performance.

Key Steps in the Process

ðŸ”¹ Defining Business Questions: I started by developing targeted questions to ensure the analysis directly addressed the company's most pressing business needs.
ðŸ”¹ Mock-up Design: Before jumping into the development phase, I created structured mock-ups of the dashboards to visualize how the insights would be presented.
ðŸ”¹ Data Cleaning & Modeling: A crucial stepâ€”cleaning and refining the dataset to make sure all the analysis was based on accurate and reliable data.
ðŸ”¹ Visualization & Insights Extraction: Using Power BI, I built interactive dashboards that transformed the raw data into clear, actionable insights for business leaders.

Key Outcomes & Insights

ðŸ”¹ Sales Performance: The business generated $1.76M in total sales. However, sales fell 11.8% short of the target.
ðŸ”¹ Customer Behavior: 32.36% of orders came from loyal customers, with the highest contributions coming from Bronze-tier members.
ðŸ”¹ Returns Analysis: The return rate spiked by 28.9%, which could indicate issues with product quality or customer satisfaction. 
ðŸ”¹ Regional Sales Trends: The North West region was a standout performer, contributing 48.05% of total sales.
